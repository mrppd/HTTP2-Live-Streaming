For Server
-----------
Format:
python h2server.py "PUSH" "PATH INCLUDING NAME OF THE FILE EXCEPT LAST PART" "VIDEO EXTENTION"

Here, PUSH value is between 1 to 3
      "PATH INCLUDING NAME OF THE FILE EXCEPT LAST PART" is a string which is path to the video archive. It also contains the filename except the last part and extention. Video file name has a specific format and consist of 3 parts and extention. It will be discussed separately.  

Example:
python h2server.py 3 "F:\Work\Educational info\Gottingen\Internet Technologies\video_archive\forest_SD" "mp4"



For Client
-----------
Format:
python h2client3.py "BUFFER" "MIN_BUFFER" "QUALITY" "AUTO_QUALITY" "SHOW_OUTPUT" "SHOW_VIDEO" "RTT"

Here, BUFFER value is between 1 to 6
      MIN_BUFFER value can be between 0 to 5
      QUALITY value ranges from 1 to 7
      AUTO_QUALITY value is either 1 or 0. For our case we should always put it 1
      SHOW_OUTPUT value is either 1 or 0. If you want to see the running statistics then put it 1.
      SHOW_VIDEO value is either 1 or 0. If 1 then you will be able to see the playback which is not important for the statistics. I prefer it to be 0 cause for some reason it slowing down the whole process.
      RTT values are 0 100 200 300 400. If you want default RTT then put 0 which is not 0 in realtime.

*Client can also be run without the parameters. In this case it will start with its default values.
Format:
python h2client3.py

Here the default valures are BUFFER=6, MIN_BUFFER=0, QUALITY=3, AUTO_QUALITY=1, SHOW_OUTPUT=1, SHOW_VIDEO=0 and RTT=0

Example:
python h2client3.py 6 0 3 1 1 0 0
or
python h2client3.py 

If you want to assign parameters, then assign all otherwise none.
Clent will run for 214 seconds and at the end, it will write some files in the source directory. This files can be used to generate plots.
